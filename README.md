4. Results
In the survey, several participants were categorized into many types of developers so it was necessary to separate the different specializations and quantify the total occurrences to obtain participation 
percentages and average values ​​of job satisfaction and salary.
A large chunk of respondent didn´t provide salary information, this NA values were removed of the dataset.
